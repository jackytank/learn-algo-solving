Start: May 29 2023

End: Expected End of June

Below is a list of topics that cover basic to advanced concepts in C#. This learning path is designed to help you learn C# from scratch and take you all the way to advanced topics, such as multithreading and design patterns. Each topic is presented as a checkbox, so you can easily track your progress.

- [x]  Introduction to C#: This topic covers the basics of C#, including variables, data types, and operators. You will also learn how to write and execute your first C# program.
    - [x]  Install .NET, Visual Studio, VSCode Extensions, ..etc..
- [x]  Variables and Data Types: In this topic, you will learn about variables and data types in C#. You will also learn how to declare and initialize variables, and how to use them in your programs.
    - [x]  Modifiers
        - [ ]  Access Modifiers (internal, private, protected, public, protected internal, private protected, file)
        - [ ]  Keywords Modifiers (virtual, volatile, override, in, out, new, async, await, extern, event, sealed, const, readonly, abstract, static, unsafe)
    - [x]  Primitive types (int. long, double, float, decimal. short, and other unsigned types)
    - [x]  Nullable types (using Nullable<T> or ? operator)
    - [x]  string type
        - [x]  [Verbatim string literals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/tokens/verbatim) (@””)
        - [x]  String interpolation ($”{var}”)
    - [x]  object type
    - [x]  dynamic type (not type safe, not known until runtime, IntelliSence is not available)
    - [x]  var type (type safe, no issue at runtime, make code shorter, reduce effort to create new class, prefer when using LINQ)
    - [x]  anonymous type (by using object initializer, not allow null, derived directly from object)
    - [x]  struct type (Not reference type, can’t be derived or become base class, only for hold data)
    - [x]  “ref” keyword and reference types
        - When a reference type (such as an object) is passed by value to a method in C#, a copy of the reference is created and passed to the method. Mean: original reference and the copy of the reference both point to the same object in memory
        - using “ref” with primitive type the behavior is expected
- [x]  Operators: This topic covers the different types of operators in C#, such as arithmetic, logical, and comparison operators. You will also learn how to use operators to perform different operations in your programs.
    - [x]  Operators (is, new, sizeof, delegate, cast, as)
        - as: should use if uncertain if conversion is success
        - cast: use if certain the conversion will be succeed
        - is, as, typeof: can be overloaded
    - [x]  Expression (with, switch, stackalloc, default)

        - [x]  goto statement (can use in for-loop and switch )
    - [x]  Iterative statement
        - [x]  foreach: use ref inside statement (recommend using ref readonly)
- [x]  Low-level shits
    - [x]  Span<T> (for string should use .AsSpan().Slice instead of .SubString() )

        - [x]  Pass a value type by value (changes **aren't** visible from the caller.)
        - [x]  Pass a value type by reference (changes **are** visible from the caller.)
        - [x]  Pass a reference type by value (changes **are** visible from the caller)
        - [x]  Pass a reference type by reference (changes **are** visible from the caller.)
    - [x]  “in” keyword (pass parameter by reference in read-only mode, you can read its value but cannot modify it) ⇒ ***Recommended*** to use in normal and multi-threaded environment
    - [x]  “out” keyword (similar to “ref” but it expect assign value to the parameter before returning)
    - [x]  Return type
        - [x]  yield return (for foreach-loop to loop over instead of return individual value)
        - [x]  ref return (return as a reference to a variable)
